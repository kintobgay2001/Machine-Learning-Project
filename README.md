**Title**
Product Demand Prediction with Machine Learning

**Introduction**
In real-world examples, if the product is not a necessity, then its demand decreases with the
increase in its price and the demand increases with the decrease in its price. Our project explores
fields through which we can predict demand for a product with machine learning.


**Case study**
A product company plans to offer discounts on its product during the upcoming holiday season.
The company wants to find the price at which its product can be a better deal compared to its
competitors. For this task, the company provided a dataset of past changes in sales based on price
changes. You need to train a model that can predict the demand for the product in the market with
different price segments.
