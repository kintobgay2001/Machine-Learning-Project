**Title**
Product Demand Prediction with Machine Learning

**Introduction**
In real-world examples, if the product is not a necessity, then its demand decreases with the
increase in its price and the demand increases with the decrease in its price. Our project explores
fields through which we can predict demand for a product with machine learning.
